# Nextcloud

:construction: This role is under construction!

An Ansible role for provisioning a server with a basic [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) instance. This role has mostly been tested on Debian 9, but you can see the complete specifications for possible operating systems [on the Nextcloud website](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/14/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#server).

This role is intended to provision the very basic existence of a Nextcloud instance. Other roles exist to spice up (by which I largely mean harden the security of and extend the capabilities of) your Nextcloud instance, such as:

* [ansible-role-tor](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/ansible-role-tor) - Securely build a system Tor and optionally configure numerous high-security Onion services.

> :information_source: See also [Stealthcloud](https://github.com/aubrel/stealthcloud), a project I am working on to provision Nextcloud with a Tor onion service.

## Nextcloud configuration

> :construction: TK-TODO: Describe how to configure variables.
